***Gnome Cunning.*** Makes mental saves against magic with advantage.

***Speak with Small Beasts.*** You can communicate simple concepts to Small beasts.

***Stout Nimbleness.*** Make attempts to escape a grapple with advantage.

## Eldritch Invocations

***Agonising Blast.*** When you hit a creature with your Eldritch Blast, deal additional damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

***Repelling Blast.*** When you hit a creature with your Eldritch Blast, you may push the target 10 feet back.

***Gift of the Everliving Ones.*** While within 100 feet of your familiar, treat any hit dice rolled to recover health as if they were maximised.

***Convocation's Child.*** As a bonus action, make Relish change in size between a Small and a Medium creature.

***Ascendant Step.*** Cast *Levitate* on yourself at will.

## Class Features

***Recovered Memories.*** As an action while standing adjacent to a corpse, you can produce an iridescent acid that consumes the corpse over the course of one minute. After the minute has passed, you can collect the acid to gain the memories of the creature from the last 48 hours of the creature's life, as well as the most important memories within their final year. You can produce this acid once, and this use recovers whenever you finish a long rest.

***Cheerful Friend.*** Speak with oozes and communicate simple concepts, even if they cannot speak a language.

***Acidic Body.*** Whenever a creature starts its turn while involved in a grapple with you, you can choose to have it suffer 2d8 acid damage.

***Side Splitting.*** At will, as an action, **or once per short or long rest as a reaction** upon taking damage, become a Medium swarm of Tiny oozes. Hit points remain the same and you function as a single unified swarm that occupies the same space as a Medium creature. While in this state, you cannot take actions other than the Dash action, your movement speed is halved, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage (including the triggering damage if used as a reaction), you gain immunity to poison damage, you don't provoke opportunity attacks, and you can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. You can choose to return to your normal form without using an action whenever you wish, provided there is room to do so.

## Gem Abilities

- +1 to spell attack rolls.
- Once per Long Rest, cast Tsunami for free.
- At the end of a Long Rest, bestow the effects of one Eldritch Invocation on an ally.
- As a reaction when attacked or caught within a damaging area of effect, expend one hit die or take a level of exhaustion to swap places with another creature that you can see within 30ft of you. If the creature is unwilling, it must make a Charisma Saving Throw against your Spell Save DC or be teleported.

#### *4th-level Necromancy*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 9d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
	If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.
	If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies.

##### Eldritch Blast

#### *Evocation cantrip*

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 120 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Two beams of crackling energy streak toward a creature or creatures of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack for each beam against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.

**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)

While these weapons are enlarged, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.

Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them deal ld4 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).

Additionally, if it has an Intelligence score of 5 or lower, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.

**Components:** V, S, M (a glowing stick of incense or a crystal vial filled with phosphorescent material)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

#### Conjuration cantrip

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** 1 minute

The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.
	If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S

	If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. WIth one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.
	A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hit it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S

##### Slime Sphere

#### 4th-level Conjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

When you cast this spell, a massive sphere of adhesive slime appears, grows, and occupies a 10-foot radius centred on a point within range. Creatures within the radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they are trapped within the sphere and are restrained. If they succeed, the creature moves to the nearest unoccuped space outside of the radius.
	At the start of each of their turns, a restrained creature can use a bonus action to make a Strength saving throw. If they fail, they remain restrained within the spehre and take 2d8 acid damage. If they succed, they exit the sphere at the nearest unoccupied location and take half as much damage. 
	Any creature that is forcibly pushed into the sphere, or enters it voluntarily, automatically becomes restrained.

##### Synaptic Static

#### 5th-level Enchantment

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 120 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You choose a point within range and cause psychic energy to explode there. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on that point must make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can't be affected by this spell. A target takes 8d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a d6 and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. The target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.
	You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve and item from an open container, or pour out the contents of a vial. You can movd the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.
	The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

##### Minor Illusion

#### Illusion cantrip

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** S, M (a bit of fleece)
**Duration:** 1 minute

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.
	If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.
	If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.
	If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the create determines the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

##### Mirror Image

#### 2nd-level illusion

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** 1 minute

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear within your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.
	Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duratino, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.
	If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. WIth one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.
	A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hit it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.
	A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

##### Ooze Cocoon

#### 4th-level Conjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The touch of your goopy paw can surround a creature in a cocoon of burning ooze. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target is restrained. 
	At the start of its turn, a restrained creature may make a Strength (Athletics) check against your Spell Save DC. On a success, it is no longer restrained and is immune to further castings of this spell for 24 hours. On a failure, it takes 2d8 acid damage and remains restrained. 
Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.

#### 4th-level Conjuration

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

When you cast this spell, a massive sphere of adhesive slime appears, grows, and occupies a 10-foot radius centred on a point within range. Creatures within the radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they are trapped within the sphere and are restrained. If they succeed, the creature moves to the nearest unoccuped space outside of the radius.
	At the start of each of their turns, a restrained creature can use a bonus action to make a Strength saving throw. If they fail, they remain restrained within the spehre and take 2d8 acid damage. If they succed, they exit the sphere at the nearest unoccupied location and take half as much damage. 
	Any creature that is forcibly pushed into the sphere, or enters it voluntarily, automatically becomes restrained.

##### Synaptic Static

#### 5th-level Enchantment

**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 120 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You choose a point within range and cause psychic energy to explode there. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on that point must make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can't be affected by this spell. A target takes 8d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a d6 and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. The target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Casting Time:** 1 minute
**Range:** Signt
**Components:** V, S

A wall of water springs into existence at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 300 feet long, 300 feet high, and 50 feet thick. The wall lasts for the duration.
	When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
	At the start of each of your turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from you. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 5d10 bludgeoning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. At the end of the turn, the wall's height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage creatures take from the spell on subsequent rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the spell ends.
	A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC in order to move at all. If it fails the check, it can't move. A creature that moves out of the area falls to the ground.
