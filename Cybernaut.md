# Cybernaut

Flicking open an ancient-looking handset, the halfling presses a few keys and smiles as the guard turrets deactivate.
	Her eyes glazed over, her breath tired and her features sallow, the young elf jacks into Cyberspace, where her fragile form is replaced by a handsome and hulking figure of an orc.

​	The seemingly disinterested aasimar drops the sunglasses down onto his face and begins scanning the crowd, picking up personal information at just a glance as he effortlessly bypasses their personal firewalls.

​	Cybernauts are defined by their relationship to technology. Whether they seek power, knowledge or simply escape, all cybernauts use their native understanding of the huge network of interconnected computers as a primary means of interacting with the world. To a cybernaut, Cyberspace is just as real as reality—and in some cases, even more so.

## You wouldn't steal a car

Cyberspace was never meant to be manipulated by the standard user. Administrative rights are tightly restricted by the sinister web of corporate and governmental factions who collectively control the electronic landscape. Whether they break the law with malicious intent, or simply fall afoul of the byzantine usage agreement that everyone signs without reading, every cybernaut is guilty of something, even if they don't yet know it. 

## Creating a Cybernaut

Almost everyone in the world uses Cyberspace from time to time, but not all of those users are cybernauts. Cybernauts may vary in their powers, but all cybernauts feel more at home in Cyberspace than in the physical world. When you're creating your cybernaut character, consider what leads them to prefer the digital world over the physical. Is cyberspace a place to escape? What are you escaping from?

​	Did you grow up playing online games, making friends online to account for a lonely life elsewhere? Or were you always good with computers, able to see things others weren't, and found yourself bypassing security protocols for the sheer joy of knowing you could?

​	Every cybernaut knows a number of scripts that reflect their ability to overcome the limitations imposed on most Cyberspace users. Where did you get your scripts? Did you learn them while interning at a megacorp, buy them on the darkweb in exchange for a juicy datapacket, or stumble across a vulnerability all by yourself?

`The cybernaut is a Gestalt class. Cybernaut class features represent a character's ability to interact with Cyberspace, which is a distinct plane-like region of the wider world. It is intended that every character in Toby's World levels has a primary class determining how they interact with the physical world and levels up as a cybernaut in tandem with their primary class. To reflect the fact that Cyberspace is completely different to the physical world in Toby's World, the cybernaut class uses a new ability score called Technology. This also maintains the balance of the existing classes and prevents Multi-Attribute-Dependent (MAD) classes from becoming more diluted. If you want to use the cybernaut in your own games, you may want to minimise the changes to the base game. In this case, you could use Intelligence instead of Technology, and make some of the 1st-level class features available to all players.`

### Quick Build

You can make a cybernaut quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score into Technology, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the Gutter Rat background. Third, choose the *bypass security* and *dark google* scripts.

## What is Cyberspace?

It's a virtual reality realm, like an MMORPG world but you can do all the things you can do on the modern-day internet.

​	Any networked technology has a Cyberspace equivalent and interacting with it by any other means than going through Cyberspace is really difficult.

​	Being connected to it occupies your senses and requires your full attention.
