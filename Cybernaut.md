# Cybernaut

##### some flavour text here

```The cybernaut class allows your characters to interact with Cyberspace, a key element of Toby's Setting. It is a Gestalt class, meaning that you level up in this class and gain all of its features alongside and at the same rate as your primary class. To avoid upsetting the existing balance of ability scores and making every class more MAD (multi-attribute dependant), most of the cybernaut's features rely on a new skill, Tech (TCH)```
