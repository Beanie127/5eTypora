***Corrosive Form.*** A creature that hits the cube with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) acid damage. The cube can eat through 1-inch-thick nonmagical wood or metal in one round.

***Magic Resistance.*** The wiggly cube has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Ooze Cube.*** The cube occupies its entire space whenever it is Medium or larger. Other creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw.
	Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total cover.
	A creature within 4 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful DC12 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 4 (1d8) acid damage.
	The cube can only hold one creature equal to its size, or four creatures of one size or more smaller than itself.

***Squishy.*** The cube is immune to falling damage.

***Transparent.*** Even when the cube is in plain sight, it takes a successful DC15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a cube that has neither moved or attacked. A creature that tries to enter the cube's space while unaware of it is surprised by the cube.

## Actions

***Pseudopod.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, range 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6+2) acid damage.

***Engulf.*** The cube moves up to its speed. While it does so, it can enter the spaces of other creatures. Whenever the cube enters the space of a hostile creature, and the creature is of the same size or smaller than the cube, it must make a DC12 Dexterity saving throw. If it succeeds, it can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the cube. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.
	On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 4 (1d8) acid damage and is engulfed. An engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 14 (3d8) acid damage at the start of each of the cube's turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC12 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.
